My main research interests lie in the direction of understanding neural systems and processes at different levels of description through the development and application of computational models. Through a 'dynamical systems lens' I am interested to investigate how the interaction between the dynamics of single neurons give rise to neuronal assemblies and what the role is of these neuronal assemblies in perception, cognition and information processing in the brain. I am particularly interested in the occurence and functions of oscillatory activity in networks of neurons, and the formation and role of synchronous and a-synchronous (chimera-like) states in the brain. Ultimately I am interested in how these processes can account for perception; organisation and development of brain structures and; the generation of behavior.
