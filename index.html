<p>
My main research interests lie in the direction of achieving an understanding of <b>neuronal systems</b> and processes at different levels of description (conceptual and qualitative) through the development and application of <b>computational models</b>. 
I want to investigate how the interaction between the dynamics of single neurons give rise to <b>neuronal assemblies</b> and what the roles of these neuronal assemblies are in perception, memory, cognition and information processing in the brain.
I am particularly interested in the occurence and functions of <b>oscillatory activity</b> in -and between- networks of neurons, and the formation and role of <b>synchronous and a-synchronous</b> (chimera-like) states in the brain.
 Ultimately, I want to know how these processes can account for perception; organisation and development of brain structures and; the generation of behavior. Finally, I wish to discover how (or whether) these <b>principles and processes</b> of the brain can give rise to <b>consciousness</b>.

<h3 style="margin:1"> Experience</h3>
<p>
I have a history in (digital) signal processing and system design/analysis, combined with solid programming education and experience. My main languages include: C++, Python and Matlab/GNU Octave. Currently, I am following a research master in Behavior and Cognition at the University of Barcelona, where I work on computational modeling and analysis of spiking neural networks.
