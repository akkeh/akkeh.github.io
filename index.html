<p>
My main research interests lie in the direction of achieving an understanding of <b>neuronal systems</b> and processes at different levels of description (conceptual and qualitative) through the development and application of <b>computational models</b>. 
I want to investigate how the interaction between the dynamics of single neurons give rise to <b>neuronal assemblies</b> and what the roles of these <b>cell assemblies</b> are in perception, memory, cognition and processing in the brain.
I am particularly interested in the occurence and functions of <b>oscillatory activity</b> in -and between- neural networks, the formation and role of <b>synchronous and a-synchronous</b> states in the brain and the <b>self-organising</b> principles underlying these phenomena.<br>
Ultimately, I wish to discover how these <b>principles and processes</b> of the brain self-organise and give rise to behavior, memory and <b>consciousness</b>.

<h3 style="margin:1"> Experience</h3>
<p>
I have a basis in (digital) <b>signal processing</b> and system design/analysis, combined with solid <b>programming</b> education and experience. My main languages include: C++, Python and Matlab/GNU Octave. Currently, I am following a research master in Behavior and Cognition at the University of Barcelona, where I work on the computational modeling of spiking neural networks with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity and the analysis of emerging cell assemblies in these balanced networks.
