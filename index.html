<p>
My main research interests strive to achieve an understanding of neuronal systems and processes at different levels of description (conceptual and qualitative) through the development and analysis of theoretical and computational models.
I am interested in what neural systems can do once the brain is not seen as a computer. My tennative hypothesis is to conceptualise the brain (and organism) as a continuum, and that the aspects to be studied are transmission and excitability in active media. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to investigate how different micro- and mesoscale neuronal dynamics and neural interactions give rise to global network dynamics, with a special interest in the emergence and organisation of neuronal assemblies and what the roles of these cell assemblies are in perception, memory, cognition and processing in the brain.
Ultimately, I wish to discover how these principles and processes of the brain self-organise and give rise to behavior, memory and consciousness.<br><br>

At the moment I am investigating <a href="./blog/20190109_Laplace.html">frequency transfer functions</a> of single neurons and small neural systems; learning in spiking neuron networks with different synaptic plasticity timescales; synchronisation in neural networks with conduction delays; roles of and transitions between local and global synchronisation in working memory networks; and <a href="./blog.html">(too) many more</a> topics.

<h3 style="margin:1; margin-bottom:0"> Experience</h3>
<p>
I have a basis in system analysis and (digital) signal processing, combined with solid programming education and experience. My main languages include: C++, Python and Matlab/GNU Octave. Recently, I finished my research master in Behavior and Cognition at the University of Barcelona. Where I carried out my master thesis project with the title <i>"A Ca2+-influx-dependent plasticity model for single compartment model exhibiting multiple STDP curves"</i> under the supervision of Matthias S. Keil.
<!--where I work on the computational modeling of spiking neural networks with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity and the analysis of emerging cell assemblies in these balanced networks.-->
