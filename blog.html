<h2 style="margin:1; margin-bottom:0"><span style="font-weight:normal"></span>Introduction
</h2>

</p>A collection of aphorisms about several topics that interest me. Among others I write about my main professional interest: theoretical neuroscience and its connection to other topics such as materialism, biotechnology, biology, society, computers and politics. Besides that I will include short snippets of code and small 'tutorials' on techniques that interest me.<br>
</p> I mainly strive to connect my <a href=proj.html>research</a> to my broader set of ideas, to place my insights in 'the real world' and to explore which effects these ideas have on eachother.

<i> Materialism; Neuroscience
</i><br>
<p>
</p>I like materialism. I believe in the creativity of matter and that matters interact forming multiplicities that are more than the sum of their parts. I do not believe that there is any sense in or necessity that being a materialist would 'force' me to think that knowing the state of things and their interactions would allow to calculate the future state of things. Or atleast that a material world would imply this any more than a dualistic worldview. I am completely in the dark as to why the problem of determinism is solved by dualism. I am still in the process of determining what makes it impossible to determine the future state of things. I do not consider the impossibility of knowing the state of all things or the precise interactions from a pure complexity point of view to be a satisfactory explaination. Thus the uncertainty principle brought forth by quantum mechanics, which seems in the end a shortcoming from our side, to be a solution either. Unless one could argue that the way of determining the position and velocity of a particle is fundamental to any interaction with that particle. But this sort of hints at the universe working as a computer which calculates, using the Rules of Physics, how each particle should behave. Which is again not satisfactory (although more of an intuitive objection than a clearly argumentable one).
</p>
</p>Thus I am still investigating what are for me satifactory explainations to this question, but this does not make it impossible to use these materialist monist ideas to theorise about the world, life and the brain. Within the determinism/free will debate the human brain has always figured on center stage, and specific anatomical regions have been singled out to be the seat of consciousness, or the interface between the material and 'other' world. So it is not suprising that within my neuroscience practise I support materialist ideas: I believe that neurons and then brain are material and that all things that we are used from our brains emerge from the interactions of material neurons. Due to the creative nature of matter, this does not lead to boring input-output transformations or conditioned responses, but a plethora of dynamics and the baffeling richness of experience. This is why I study theoretical neuroscience: as I see it, it is the study of what neural systems could do. For me, theoretical neuroscience investigates what our theories and models of neurons are capable of doing. This brings an interesting layering of abstraction and a series of fault introducing translations, which lead to a comforting and pleasing chain of errors. Comforting, because it prevents us from arguing with any certainty that the brain works in this or that manner, and thus does not provide any ground for choosing this over that, opression or governing. It is pleasing, because it always keeps the door open for other possibilities.
