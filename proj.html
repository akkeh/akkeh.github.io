    Neurons are connected through axons and dendrites which transmit signals from one neuron to the other with finite velocities, leading to delays between the firing of one neuron and the arrival of the resultant pulses to other neurons. However, (heterogeneous) delays generally largely complicate the analysis of (neuronal) systems, which has lead to the ommission of transmission delays in the prevalent accounts of neuronal functioning and the interpretationof neuronal connectivity.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, it is assumed that the specific connectivity between neurons results in the functioning of neural networks. Focussing on a single neuron receiving several inputs, each connection is primarily apprehended by the strengths of the connection: a stronger excitatory (inhibitory) connection from one neuron to the other leads to an increased (decreased) co-occurence of their activation. Thus for an excitatory connection, increased firing of the former neuron leads to an increased firing of the latter neuron.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;However, once you include transmission delays into the analysis of neuronal networks, the above interpretation of synaptic strenghts does not hold. A neuron receiving correlated inputs through different input 'lines' with different delays can be interpreted as a finite impulse response filter, meaning that the delay times and synaptic strenghts determine the frequencies that this neuron is sensitive to. In this project I investigate the merits and limitations of this finite impulse response view.

    <h2 style="margin:1; margin-bottom:0">Mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity </h2>
    <i>synaptic plasticity; calcium influx; NMDA receptors</i>
    <p><a name="caidp"></a>
    Correlation in the activity of two neurons leads to a strengthening of the connection between them. Conversely, uncorrelated activity should lead to a decrease in synaptic strenght.Â Yet, how does this phenomenological description arise from the mechanisms available to neurons? This project aims to develop models connecting known and plausible biophysics of synapses with phenomenological and conceptual descriptions of synaptic plasticity, at different scales of biophysical detail. Especially, investigating predictions proposed by these models and their effects on the dynamics of spiking networks
