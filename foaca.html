<h1>manifesto</h1>
  <p>
    A spectre wanders through the world of academia &mdash;the spectre of open science. It wanders &mdash;stumbles&mdash; but does not haunt. 
  </p>
  <h2>academia now is a bourgeois academia</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>towards an academia of the people: a free and open academia</h2>
  <p>
	</p>
  
  <h2>demands:</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> the point of [science] is "to widen the choices of individuals" (Rooum1995, intro)</li>
      <li> do away with competitive grant schemes and tenure procedures which promote the deepening of existing trenches, the widening of the wealth, knowledge and life-quality gap, and the establishment of the status-quo. Within this it is crucial to abolish the practise of references (reference letters) for job and grant applications, eradicate cronyism.</li>
    </ul></li>

    In the end it is a question of what we want; it is a political or philosophical question. 
    Do we believe in equality and equity, that everyone should be free to choose and live their life as they see fit? 
    And do we see that science can &mdash;or should&mdash; contribute to this (TODO: citations on sciences' influence on society)? 
    Then join me in the struggle.
